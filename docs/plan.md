# Mini E-Commerce Backend — Phased Manual Development Backlog

## Project Architecture

**Architecture:** NestJS Modular Monolith

**Core stack:**

* NestJS
* TypeScript
* PostgreSQL
* TypeORM
* Redis
* RabbitMQ
* BullMQ
* Docker / Docker Compose
* REST
* JWT
* Jest / Integration / E2E testing

### Core architectural rule

PostgreSQL is the source of truth for transactional business state.

Redis, RabbitMQ, and BullMQ are infrastructure components and must not become the authoritative source for:

* Inventory
* Reservations
* Orders
* Payments
* Other transactional business state

The application remains a **modular monolith**.

Do not split modules into microservices unless a demonstrated requirement appears later.

---

# Phase 0 — Existing Foundation

**Status: DONE / EXISTING**

The project already has the basic e-commerce foundation.

### Existing areas

* [x] NestJS application
* [x] TypeScript
* [x] PostgreSQL
* [x] TypeORM
* [x] Docker-based development infrastructure
* [x] Redis infrastructure
* [x] RabbitMQ infrastructure
* [x] Authentication module
* [x] Users
* [x] Products
* [x] Cart
* [x] Cart items
* [x] Basic centralized error handling
* [x] Validation infrastructure
* [x] REST API structure

### Architectural decisions already established

* [x] Modular monolith architecture
* [x] Product does not own inventory state
* [x] Inventory is a separate domain
* [x] Reservation is a separate domain
* [x] PostgreSQL is the transactional source of truth
* [x] Redis is not authoritative for inventory
* [x] Inventory concurrency must be handled at the database level
* [x] Background processing must not replace transactional consistency

### Important previous Cart/Inventory decision

The cart should not directly mutate inventory.

The inventory lifecycle belongs to the inventory/reservation/order workflow.

---

# Phase 1 — Inventory Foundation

**Status: DONE — 2026-08-21** (inventory entity, constraints, business API, REST controller, migration, tests, random seeding)

**Goal:** Introduce inventory as a first-class domain without implementing reservations yet.

## 1.1 Inventory Entity

Create the Inventory entity with:

```text
Inventory
---------
id
product_id
stock
reserved_amount
created_at
updated_at
```

### Rules

* [x] `stock >= 0` — `CHK_inventory_stock_non_negative` on `Inventory.stock`
* [x] `reserved_amount >= 0` — `CHK_inventory_reserved_non_negative`
* [x] `reserved_amount <= stock` — `CHK_inventory_reserved_lte_stock`
* [x] `product_id` references Product — `FK_inventory_productId` (`Product.id` ON DELETE CASCADE)
* [x] Decide whether one product can have exactly one inventory record — **one-to-one**, `Inventory` owns FK, `UQ_inventory_productId` + `@Index(productId)`
* [x] Add appropriate unique constraint for `product_id` — done

Do not store `available` as an independently mutable database field.

Calculate:

```text
available = stock - reserved_amount
```

## 1.2 Inventory Module

Create:

```text
inventory/
├── inventory.module.ts
├── inventory.controller.ts
├── inventory.service.ts
├── entities/
└── dto/
```

Follow the repository's existing structure rather than blindly creating this exact layout.

## 1.3 Inventory Business API

Expose business operations rather than allowing other modules to mutate the entity directly.

Conceptually:

```text
getInventory()
checkAvailability()
increaseStock()
decreaseStock()
reserve()
releaseReservation()
completeSale()
```

Exact names should follow existing project conventions.

## 1.4 Inventory Tests

* [x] Create inventory — unit `createForProduct` + integration `INSERT` succeeds
* [x] Read inventory — `getInventory` + `GET /inventory/:productId`
* [x] Calculate available quantity — `available = stock - reservedAmount` getter, integration asserts 7
* [x] Reject negative stock — `CHK` + `ConflictException`, integration `stock=-1` throws
* [x] Reject invalid reserved amount — `CHK reservedAmount>=0` and `<=stock`, integration throws
* [x] Prevent invalid inventory state — all three DB checks + `UQ productId` verified

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria

Inventory exists independently from Product and the database enforces its basic invariants. — **MET**: `Inventory` entity owns `stock`/`reservedAmount`, `Product.stock` removed, `InventoryService` is sole mutation point, REST API thin, migration `1755800000000-CreateInventoryAndDropProductStock` (seed + drop) executed, `synchronize: false`, unit 26 + integration 7 PASS, 5 products seeded with random stock 67-174.

---

# Phase 2 — Reservation Domain

**Status: DONE — 2026-08-22** (Reservation + ReservationItem entities, ReservationService/Controller, state machine, migration, REST API, tests)

**Goal:** Introduce temporary inventory ownership.

## 2.1 Reservation Entity

Create:

```text
Reservation
-----------
id
user_id
order_id nullable
status
expires_at
created_at
updated_at
```

Recommended states:

```text
RESERVED
COMPLETED
EXPIRED
CANCELLED
```

Do not add unnecessary states.

## 2.2 Reservation Item

Because checkout can contain multiple products, use:

```text
ReservationItem
---------------
id
reservation_id
inventory_id
quantity
```

Relationship:

```text
Reservation
    |
    ├── ReservationItem
    ├── ReservationItem
    └── ReservationItem
```

Each item references Inventory.

## 2.3 Reservation Module

Create a dedicated reservation module.

Responsibilities:

* [x] Create reservation (`POST /reservations` → `RESERVED`, default `expiresAt=now+15m`, validation `quantity>0`, future `expiresAt`, duplicate `inventoryId` rejected, FK `inventoryId`/`orderId` checked)
* [x] Add reservation items (`ReservationItem` with `@Unique reservationId+inventoryId`, `@Check quantity>0`, FK `inventoryId`)
* [x] Complete reservation (`PATCH /:id/complete` → `RESERVED→COMPLETED`, optional `orderId` validated)
* [x] Cancel reservation (`PATCH /:id/cancel` → `RESERVED→CANCELLED`)
* [x] Expire reservation (`PATCH /:id/expire` admin-only → `RESERVED→EXPIRED`, future worker will use `status+expiresAt` index)
* [x] Retrieve reservation (`GET /:id` owner-or-admin, `GET /` paginated owner-scoped with admin `userId` filter)
* [x] Validate reservation state transitions (`validateTransition` enforces `RESERVED→COMPLETED|EXPIRED|CANCELLED` only, others `409`)

### Phase 2 Exit Criteria

The system can represent a temporary claim on one or more inventory records. — **MET**: `Reservation` (`userId` FK CASCADE, `orderId` FK SET NULL, `status` enum, `expiresAt` timestamptz, indexes `userId/status/expiresAt/status+expiresAt`) + `ReservationItem` (unique + CHECK) entities present; `ReservationService` (EntityManager writes `create/complete/cancel/expire`, `validateTransition`, `assertOwner`) + thin `ReservationController` (6 REST routes, `Auth`/`CurrentUser`, transaction wrapping) implemented; migration `1755850000000-CreateReservationAndReservationItem` (enum, tables, indexes, FKs) executed; unit 30 + integration 8 PASS (real PostgreSQL, constraints verified); `synchronize:false`, module boundaries respected.

---

# Phase 3 — Transaction-Safe Reservation

**Status: NOT DONE**

This is the most important implementation phase.

**Goal:** Prevent overselling under concurrency.

## 3.1 Reservation Transaction

Reservation creation must execute atomically:

```text
BEGIN

    Lock inventory rows

        ↓

    Check availability

        ↓

    Increase reserved_amount

        ↓

    Create Reservation

        ↓

    Create ReservationItems

COMMIT
```

If anything fails:

```text
ROLLBACK
```

## 3.2 Row-Level Locking

Use PostgreSQL row-level locking where appropriate:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM inventory
WHERE id = ?
FOR UPDATE;
```

For multiple inventory records:

* [ ] Lock every required inventory row
* [ ] Use a deterministic ordering when acquiring multiple locks
* [ ] Avoid unnecessary locking
* [ ] Keep the transaction short

Deterministic lock ordering is important because multiple-resource transactions can otherwise create unnecessary deadlock risk.

## 3.3 Availability Rule

For every inventory record:

```text
available = stock - reserved_amount
```

Reservation succeeds only when:

```text
available >= requested_quantity
```

## 3.4 Concurrency Test

Test:

```text
stock = 10
reserved = 8

User A requests 2
User B requests 2
```

Expected:

```text
User A → SUCCESS
User B → INSUFFICIENT INVENTORY
```

Never:

```text
A → SUCCESS
B → SUCCESS
```

### Phase 3 Exit Criteria

Concurrent reservation requests cannot oversell inventory.

---

# Phase 4 — Reservation Lifecycle

**Status: NOT DONE**

**Goal:** Make reservation state transitions explicit and safe.

## 4.1 Reservation Creation

```text
NONE
 ↓
RESERVED
```

When created:

```text
inventory.reserved_amount += quantity
```

## 4.2 Reservation Completion

```text
RESERVED
 ↓
COMPLETED
```

On successful sale:

```text
stock -= quantity
reserved_amount -= quantity
```

Example:

```text
Before:

stock = 10
reserved = 3
available = 7

After sale:

stock = 7
reserved = 0
available = 7
```

## 4.3 Reservation Cancellation

```text
RESERVED
 ↓
CANCELLED
```

Release:

```text
reserved_amount -= quantity
```

Stock does not change.

## 4.4 Reservation Expiration

```text
RESERVED
 ↓
EXPIRED
```

Release:

```text
reserved_amount -= quantity
```

Stock does not change.

## 4.5 State Transition Rules

Implement explicit transition rules.

Invalid examples:

```text
COMPLETED → EXPIRED
COMPLETED → CANCELLED
EXPIRED → COMPLETED
CANCELLED → COMPLETED
```

must not be silently accepted.

### Phase 4 Exit Criteria

Every reservation has a well-defined lifecycle and inventory remains synchronized with the reservation state.

---

# Phase 5 — Reservation Expiration / Cleanup

**Status: NOT DONE**

**Goal:** Automatically release expired inventory.

## 5.1 Expiration Source of Truth

The authoritative rule is:

```text
expires_at <= current_time
```

The database field determines whether a reservation is expired.

The cleanup worker does not define expiration.

It only discovers and processes expired reservations.

## 5.2 Cleanup Process

Conceptually:

```sql
WHERE status = 'RESERVED'
AND expires_at <= NOW()
```

For each candidate:

```text
BEGIN

    Lock reservation

        ↓

    Verify status is still RESERVED

        ↓

    Lock relevant inventory

        ↓

    Release reserved quantity

        ↓

    Mark reservation EXPIRED

COMMIT
```

## 5.3 Race Conditions

Handle cases such as:

```text
Cleanup worker
       +
Checkout completion
       +
Cancellation
```

happening concurrently.

Only one state transition should win.

The losing operation must safely detect that the reservation is no longer `RESERVED`.

## 5.4 Cleanup Job

Use the project's existing background-job infrastructure.

Decide during implementation whether this workload belongs in:

* BullMQ
* NestJS scheduler
* another already-existing mechanism

Do not introduce infrastructure without a reason.

### Phase 5 Exit Criteria

Expired reservations eventually release inventory and concurrent expiration/completion/cancellation cannot corrupt inventory.

---

# Phase 6 — Order Integration

**Status: NOT DONE**

**Goal:** Connect reservations to Orders.

## 6.1 Order Model

Conceptually:

```text
Order
-----
id
user_id
status
total
created_at
updated_at
```

Order item:

```text
OrderItem
---------
id
order_id
product_id
quantity
unit_price
```

## 6.2 Historical Price

When the order is created:

```text
unit_price = Product.price
```

The OrderItem keeps this value.

Historical orders must not depend on the current Product price.

## 6.3 Checkout Flow

The exact checkout behavior must first be specified.

Current architectural direction:

```text
Client
  ↓
Cart
  ↓
Checkout
  ↓
Validate cart
  ↓
Reserve inventory
  ↓
Create order
  ↓
Create order items
  ↓
Commit
```

The exact transaction boundary must be decided in the feature specification.

## 6.4 Important Unresolved Requirement

Before implementation, decide:

```text
When does inventory become reserved?
```

Possible choices:

```text
A. When item is added to cart
B. When checkout starts
C. When order is created
D. Another explicit business stage
```

Do not implement this assumption silently.

### Phase 6 Exit Criteria

A successful checkout produces a consistent Order + OrderItems + Reservation + Inventory state.

---

# Phase 7 — Order Completion / Sale

**Status: NOT DONE**

**Goal:** Convert reserved inventory into sold inventory.

## 7.1 Successful Completion

Conceptually:

```text
Reservation
    ↓
COMPLETED

Inventory:
stock -= quantity
reserved_amount -= quantity
```

This must be transactional.

## 7.2 Payment

The project currently does not define a payment provider.

Therefore:

* [ ] Do not invent a payment integration
* [ ] Define payment state separately when payment requirements exist
* [ ] Specify what happens when payment fails
* [ ] Specify what happens when payment succeeds

### Phase 7 Exit Criteria

A completed sale permanently decreases stock while releasing its reservation.

---

# Phase 8 — Order Cancellation

**Status: NOT DONE**

**Goal:** Define and implement inventory behavior when orders are cancelled.

## 8.1 Cancellation Before Sale

If inventory is still reserved:

```text
reserved_amount -= quantity
```

Stock remains unchanged.

## 8.2 Cancellation After Sale

If inventory has already been sold:

```text
stock += quantity
```

The exact behavior depends on the business meaning of cancellation/refund.

## 8.3 Required Order State Machine

Before coding cancellation:

* [ ] Define Order statuses
* [ ] Define valid transitions
* [ ] Define cancellation rules per status
* [ ] Define inventory effect per status
* [ ] Define payment/refund behavior

### Phase 8 Exit Criteria

Cancellation cannot accidentally double-release or double-return inventory.

---

# Phase 9 — Redis / Caching

**Status: PARTIALLY DONE / INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS**

Redis already exists in the project infrastructure.

The remaining work is deciding where caching actually provides value.

## Tasks

* [ ] Define product cache strategy
* [ ] Define cache keys
* [ ] Define TTLs
* [ ] Invalidate cache after product mutation
* [ ] Test cache miss
* [ ] Test cache hit
* [ ] Test invalidation

Example:

```text
product:{productId}
```

## Important Rule

Do NOT use Redis as the authoritative inventory store.

Never make:

```text
Redis inventory
    ↓
reservation decision
```

the source of truth.

The authoritative path is:

```text
PostgreSQL transaction
    ↓
Inventory row
    ↓
Reservation
```

---

# Phase 10 — Rate Limiting

**Status: PARTIALLY DONE / INFRASTRUCTURE DIRECTION EXISTS**

The application already has rate-limiting requirements.

Remaining work:

* [ ] Define protected endpoints
* [ ] Define limits per endpoint/use case
* [ ] Decide whether distributed rate limiting is required
* [ ] Use Redis for shared state when multiple API instances are used
* [ ] Test rate-limit behavior
* [ ] Test behavior when Redis is unavailable

Rate limiting must never compromise transactional inventory correctness.

---

# Phase 11 — Asynchronous Events / Notifications

**Status: NOT DONE**

**Goal:** Separate non-critical work from the transactional path.

The core pattern should be:

```text
Database Transaction
        ↓
Commit
        ↓
Event / Job
        ↓
Worker
        ↓
Notification / Integration
```

Potential events:

```text
OrderCreated
OrderCompleted
OrderCancelled
ReservationExpired
```

Potential consumers:

```text
Notification worker
Email service
External integration
Analytics
```

## RabbitMQ

Use RabbitMQ where asynchronous messaging between components/workflows provides value.

## BullMQ

Use BullMQ where the workload is naturally a background job:

```text
Reservation cleanup
Notification retries
Scheduled processing
```

The exact division between RabbitMQ and BullMQ remains a design decision.

### Phase 11 Exit Criteria

Asynchronous failures do not roll back already committed business transactions.

---

# Phase 12 — Reliability / Idempotency

**Status: NOT DONE**

This phase becomes important once background processing and events exist.

## Tasks

* [ ] Identify retryable operations
* [ ] Make reservation expiration idempotent
* [ ] Make notification jobs idempotent
* [ ] Prevent duplicate order completion
* [ ] Prevent duplicate inventory release
* [ ] Define event/job retry behavior
* [ ] Define failure handling

Example:

If the cleanup worker processes the same reservation twice:

```text
First attempt:
RESERVED → EXPIRED
reserved_amount -= quantity

Second attempt:
reservation is already EXPIRED
→ do nothing
```

The second attempt must not subtract inventory again.

---

# Phase 13 — Database Constraints & Indexes

**Status: PARTIALLY DONE / DESIGN DEFINED, IMPLEMENTATION NOT COMPLETE**

## Constraints

Implement where appropriate:

```text
stock >= 0
reserved_amount >= 0
reserved_amount <= stock
quantity > 0
price >= 0
```

## Indexes

Evaluate based on actual queries:

```text
users.email

inventory.product_id

reservation.status
reservation.expires_at
reservation.user_id
reservation.order_id

reservation_item.reservation_id
reservation_item.inventory_id

order.user_id

order_item.order_id
```

Do not blindly create every proposed index.

Verify query patterns first.

### Phase Exit Criteria

The database enforces important business invariants and common access paths are indexed appropriately.

---

# Phase 14 — Testing

**Status: NOT DONE**

Testing should be implemented progressively rather than postponed until the end.

## Unit Tests

* [ ] Inventory availability
* [ ] Reservation creation rules
* [ ] Reservation state transitions
* [ ] Expiration rules
* [ ] Inventory business methods
* [ ] DTO validation

## Integration Tests

* [ ] PostgreSQL transactions
* [ ] Reservation creation
* [ ] Inventory release
* [ ] Reservation expiration
* [ ] Order completion
* [ ] Order cancellation
* [ ] Database constraints

## Concurrency Tests

Critical test:

```text
Inventory = final 1 unit

Request A → 1
Request B → 1
```

Expected:

```text
A → success
B → conflict
```

Never:

```text
A → success
B → success
```

## E2E

Complete flow:

```text
Register
 ↓
Login
 ↓
Browse product
 ↓
Add to cart
 ↓
Checkout
 ↓
Reservation
 ↓
Order
 ↓
Completion
```

Expiration flow:

```text
Reservation
 ↓
Time passes
 ↓
Cleanup
 ↓
Expiration
 ↓
Inventory released
```

Cancellation flow:

```text
Order
 ↓
Cancel
 ↓
Inventory released/restored
```

---

# Phase 15 — Documentation & Spec-Driven Development

The project already has an architectural direction and should now turn it into maintainable documentation.

## Documentation

# Immediate Development Roadmap

Do NOT work through all remaining items at once.

Work in this order:

## Current Milestone — Inventory

```text
Phase 1
Inventory Foundation
        ↓
Phase 2
Reservation Domain
        ↓
Phase 3
Transaction-Safe Reservation
        ↓
Phase 4
Reservation Lifecycle
        ↓
Phase 5
Expiration Cleanup
```

Only after these are stable:

```text
Phase 6
Order Integration
        ↓
Phase 7
Order Completion
        ↓
Phase 8
Cancellation
```

Then infrastructure/reliability:

```text
Phase 9
Redis / Cache

Phase 10
Rate Limiting

Phase 11
Async Events / Notifications

Phase 12
Idempotency / Reliability

Phase 13
Database Optimization
```

Finally:

```text
Phase 14
Complete Testing

Phase 15
Documentation / Spec Verification
```

---

# Manual Development Rule

For every phase:

```text
1. Read existing code
2. Identify affected modules
3. Write/confirm the specification
4. Clarify unresolved business decisions
5. Design the database changes
6. Design the service boundaries
7. Implement the smallest increment
8. Write tests
9. Run existing tests
10. Verify database behavior
11. Update documentation
12. Mark the phase complete
```

Do not implement future phases prematurely.

For example:

**Do not implement Order Completion while Reservation Creation is still untested.**

**Do not implement RabbitMQ events before the transactional business operation is correct.**

**Do not optimize Redis caching before the PostgreSQL inventory path is correct.**

---

## Next Manual Task

The next task should be:

**Phase 2 — Reservation Domain**

Start with:

```text
1. Design Reservation + ReservationItem entities (one-to-many, FK inventoryId)
2. Add reservation statuses (RESERVED, COMPLETED, EXPIRED, CANCELLED)
3. Create ReservationModule with service + repository
4. Implement create/add/complete/cancel/expire/retrieve + state-transition validation
5. Wire InventoryService reserve/release/completeSale (Phase 3 locking)
6. Add unit/integration tests (real PostgreSQL)
7. Verify DB constraints + indexes (reservation.status, expires_at, etc.)
```

Do not implement transaction-safe locking or expiration cleanup yet (Phases 3-5).

The purpose of the next phase is to represent a temporary claim on inventory that later phases can make transactional and expirable.
